# Tank Game

The idea that we had for our project was to create some sort of multiplayer tank game. The perspective would be top-down, showing tanks, clear spaces, and walls. Players would have the ability to move their tank around, aim, and shoot at other players in an attempt to be the last one standing. In this browser game, players have the ability to join friends through a public lobby system.
